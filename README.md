## Why Reproducibiltiy?
Reproducibility - enables others to verify and build upon someone work. In the context of low-resource Question Answering (QA), it becomes even more crucial due to the challenges posed by limited data availability. This GitHub page aims to share best practices to enhance reproducibility in low-resource QA research, specifically Ethiopic languages QA. Generally, reproducibility promots:
- Verification of Results: allows others to verify findings by replicating experiments or analyses.
- Building on Previous Work: When research is reproducible, others can build upon it, advancing the field more effectively. It enables researchers to use previous studies as a foundation for further innovation and exploration. 
- Transparency and Trust: enhances the transparency of research processes, fostering trust within the scientific community and among the public. It demonstrates rigorous methodology and reduces the likelihood of errors or fraudulent practices. 
- Identification of Errors: help identifying mistakes or biases in research, whether they arise from methodological flaws, data mishandling, or other issues. 
- Efficiency and Resource Sharing: Researchers can save time and resources by accessing reproducible studies, avoiding redundant efforts in recreating methods or data processing steps. 
- Improved Collaboration: Reproducibility promotes collaboration by providing clear guidelines and detailed documentation that others can follow.
